      <h2 id="making-smg2mm">Making SMG2MM</h2>
      <p>
        SMG2MM started as "Rolling Mario Galaxy (2)" during the pandemic when I didn't have much to do.<br>
        The concept of the mod was simply playing every base game SMG2 level on the Star Ball.<br>
        The first modification I made was to Haunty Halls Galaxy. Though it was simple, there was<br>
        a lot to learn. When I finally got it working, I noticed how tough it made the level.<br>
        I tried it on other levels, and realized that some levels would simply not work with the Star Ball.<br>
        So, I decided to make some original levels as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Dessert Desert Galaxy - August 2020</h3>
      <p>I wanted to have a level with a combination of themes.<br>
        Treat and Desert was one of the ideas and it was the one I went with.<br>
        I looked at the desert levels from both games and the treat levels from both games and used objects from
        each.<br>
        Then I uploaded a video of it to YouTube and it got quite a bit of attention.<br><br>

      </p>
      <h3>Discarded Debris Galaxy - October 2020</h3>
      <p>
        It was originally called "Black Hole Galaxy" but it was changed to have alliteration.<br>
        I streamed working on the level on YouTube as well. The original concept of the level was that the galaxies that
        were replaced were *Discarded* into a *Black Hole* and Mario (or Luigi!) must platform across...the platforms.
      </p>
      <h3>Double Beat Galaxy - January 2021</h3>
      <p>
        I came up with the concept in one of my classes.<br>
        I sketched the level design and went from there. If I can find the sketch I'll upload it here.<br>
        I was able to make it in a week; it was a simple concept.<br>
        Of course, I uploaded it to YouTube and it got lots of views.<br>
        This galaxy was kind of a pain. The platforms in Beat Block Galaxy<br>
        have a lot of polygons so I had to make models that merged<br>
        those platforms together. One of the sides is removed to try<br>
        to save on polygons, too.

      <h3>Yoshi Station Galaxy - January 2021</h3>
      <p>
        This level is meant to be a combination of Yoshi Star and Sky Station Galaxy.<br>
        I've always thought it would be neat if Yoshi was brought to his actual house.<br>
        The berries on top of the house can finally be enjoyed by Yoshi.<br>
        Later I added a section because I felt the galaxy was too similar to the vanilla game.
      </p>
      <h3>Rolling Randomness Galaxy - February 2021</h3>
      <p>
        I took two levels from Rolling Mario Galaxy (2) and combined them into one.<br>
        I added some bob-omb spawners to Mario Squared to make it more interesting. <br>
        Some people struggle with Star Ball levels so I made this and Dessert Desert <br>
        last in the hack so that it doesn't stop them from playing the other levels. <br>
        I don't struggle with the Star Ball as much as others. <br>
        However, Rolling Randomness is a tough level even for me.
      </p>
      <h2>Scrapped Things</h2>
      <h3>Bowser Jr's Freaky Factory</h3>
      <p>
        You know Chibi Robo: Zip Lash? This level was about as fun as that.<br>
        The only "gimmick" in the level was the conveyors.<br>
        Also you had to activate 2 switches to open a door that had more switches.<br>
        Those switches had to all be activated within a certain time.<br>
        It was not fun so it didn't make the full release.
      </p>
      <h3>Candy Cloud Galaxy</h3>
      <p>
        This is the level Xandog worked on. It was another theme clash, of course.<br>
        I remember making a special lollipop platform for this level.<br>
        One of the missions had the Mecha Bowser from SMG1 remade in SMG2.<br>
        Another mission was the chimp's challenge, similarly to the one in Fluffy Bluff.<br>
        Xandog wasn't very proud of the level and there was already a candy themed level,<br>
        so we decided to not include it.
      </p>
      <h3>The Achievement System</h3>
      <p>
        People who stuck around before SMG2MM released probably remember this.<br>
        Basically, you'd play the game and small levels would unlock.<br>
        It needed a certain amount of comet medals, a certain amount of starbits, etc.<br>
        But these were easily obtained by just playing the mod.<br>
        Also I wasn't sure what to put, so it was scrapped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I may release these just for the heck of it. If I get them to work...
      </p>
      <h2 id="burnout">Burnout</h2>
      <p>
        This is why SMG2: More Missions took so long. School got in the way and I wasn't <br>
        motivated to work on something that wasn't as cool as other mods.<br>
        Also I completely ran out of ideas for levels that I could reasonably make.<br>
        I didn't want to cancel the hack either, though. I didn't want to contribute to<br>
        the "thing" about SMG2 Mods: they always get cancelled.
      </p>
      <h2 id="end">End</h2>
      <p>
        Well, that's really all I have to say about SMG2MM's development. Hopefully this<br>
        gave some background on why the hack took so long and why it's not as great as<br>
        something like Neo Mario Galaxy.
